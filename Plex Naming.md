# Best Practices for File Naming in Plex

Properly naming your movie and TV show files is crucial for a smooth and organized media library experience in Plex. Following these best practices will help Plex accurately identify and match your media content.

## Movies

### File Naming Format
```
Movie Title (Release Year).ext
```
Replace `Movie Title` with the actual title of the movie and `Release Year` with the year the movie was released. Replace `.ext` with the appropriate file extension (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mkv`).

### Example
```
The Shawshank Redemption (1994).mp4
```

## TV Shows

### File Naming Format
```
Show Title - SxxExx - Episode Title.ext
```
- Replace `Show Title` with the actual title of the TV show.
- Replace `SxxExx` with the season and episode numbers in the format of two digits each (e.g., S01E01 for Season 1, Episode 1).
- Replace `Episode Title` with the title of the episode.
- Replace `.ext` with the appropriate file extension (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mkv`).

### Example
```
Game of Thrones - S01E01 - Winter Is Coming.mp4
```

## Additional Tips

- **Use Hyphens:** Use hyphens `-` to separate words in file names for both movies and TV shows.
- **Consistent Capitalization:** Maintain consistent capitalization in the file names to avoid confusion.
- **Avoid Special Characters:** Use only letters, numbers, and hyphens in file names to ensure compatibility.
- **Leading Zeros:** Always use leading zeros for season and episode numbers (e.g., S01E01, not S1E1).
- **Metadata Fetching:** Plex uses file names to fetch metadata, so accurate naming is essential for proper matching.
- **Folder Structure:** Organize movies and TV shows into separate folders to help Plex identify content correctly.
- **Multi-Episode Files:** If a single file contains multiple episodes, indicate this in the file name (e.g., S01E01E02).

By following these file naming best practices, you'll enhance your Plex media library's organization and ensure accurate matching and display of your movies and TV shows.
